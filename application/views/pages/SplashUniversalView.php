				<h1>Why Jobgram?</h1>
				<p>
					You are already employed, but you want a new job. Jobgram lets you
					create an <strong>anonymous</strong> profile. Recruiters will message 
					you and request to see your full profile.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					Jobgram <strong>never</strong> shows your full profile without your
					permission. We're here to help you find jobs, not lose them!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h1>Alternatives</h1>
				<p>
					No other site lets you get recruited <strong>anonymously</strong>.
					Jobgram lets you control the information you share, so you're not 
					risking your current job.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h1>How it works</h1>
				<p>
					Use your LinkedIn profile to create an anonymous profile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recruiters will be able to search for your anonymous profile. They
					will send you messages showing interest in you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the recruiter sounds interesting, you can give them access to your
					full profile.
